README: Deploying GitHub Repo Status Checker to Cloud Run Jobs
This README explains how to deploy the provided Python code as a Cloud Run Job to periodically check the status of GitHub repositories.

Prerequisites:

Google Cloud Project: You'll need an active Google Cloud Project with billing enabled.
Google Cloud SDK: Install the Google Cloud SDK (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
Docker: Install Docker on your local machine (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
Service Account: Create a service account with permissions to access Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and potentially other services your code interacts with.
Configuration:

Environment Variables:

Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:
GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_github_access_token
GCS_BUCKET=your_gcs_bucket_name
GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN: A GitHub Personal Access Token with permissions to read repository information.
GCS_BUCKET: The name of your GCS bucket where the code will write output.
Requirements:

Create a requirements.txt file listing the Python dependencies:
google-cloud-storage
github3.py
Deployment:

Build the Docker Image:

docker build -t github-status-checker .
Push the Image to Artifact Registry (or another container registry):

Replace us-central1 and my-repo with your desired region and repository name.
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
docker tag github-status-checker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/your-project-id/my-repo/github-status-checker:latest
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/your-project-id/my-repo/github-status-checker:latest
Deploy to Cloud Run Jobs:

Replace placeholders with your values.
gcloud run jobs create github-status-job \
  --image=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/your-project-id/my-repo/github-status-checker:latest \
  --region=your-region \
  --service-account=your-service-account-email \
  --set-env-vars=GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_github_access_token,GCS_BUCKET=your_gcs_bucket_name \
  --schedule="* * * * *"  # Run every minute (adjust as needed)
Explanation:

The code defines a Cloud Run Job that runs on a schedule.
The job uses a Docker image built from your code.
Environment variables provide configuration to the running job.
The job checks GitHub repository status and writes the results to GCS.
Customization:

Schedule: Adjust the --schedule flag to control how often the job runs.
Code Logic: Modify the Python code to customize the repository checks, data processing, or output format.
Monitoring:

You can monitor the job's execution logs and status in the Cloud Run console.
This README provides a basic guide. Refer to the Cloud Run Jobs documentation for more advanced configuration options.
